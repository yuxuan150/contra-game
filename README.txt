#Contra Game
## Project Summary and Description
Our game features two players collaborating to defeat enemies using swords . Enemies are generated randomly, and the game ends once the players collectively defeat five enemies. A counter at the top of the screen tracks the number of enemies defeated. The background dynamically shifts to the right or left when players reach the respective screen edges and continue moving in that direction. The game adopts a 2D side-scrolling view where players interact with the environment and enemies. Conversely, if they successfully eliminate all
enemies, they win. The game includes background music that plays throughout. The hardware-software integration is achieved using a MicroBlaze-based System-on-Chip (SoC), combining dynamic gameplay mechanics with a smooth gaming experience. VGA Display: Implemented using hardware modules to render the game graphics in real-time, including the player, enemies, bullets, and background in System Verilog(Vivado). Keyboard Input: Utilizing the MAX3421E USB host controller, the game will support standard keyboard input for player controls, such as movement and shooting. Integration of SoC Elements: Using the MicroBlaze processor to manage game logic, keyboard input, and interfacing with peripherals, while the read and write data from the keyboard will be implemented through C code(Vitis). So we need connect screen, keyboard to FPGA in order to play this game
